    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5>"Frisky"Paws? Does that mean it's NSFW centric?</h5>
            <p>Not at all! While we will have content filters and host content that can be categorized between Safe,
                Suggestive, Mature and Explicit. We always found "frisky" to be sort of "playful" and will be catering
                to all kinds of content.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5>Isn't there a FriskyPaws Dog Treats/Pet Brush/Pet Sitting/Animal Rescue/etc?</h5>
            <p>Yep! Doesn't stop us from using the name, none of them have reserved the domain name and none of them are
                in the same "space" we are in, it's a fairly popular "cutesy" name.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5>When are you going to release?</h5>
            <p>We'd love to have a beta up before the end of 2019, and we're aiming to be in production before FWA 2020
                (the plan is "the presentation we made won't be valid for the next con we run a panel at")</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5>So just art?</h5>
            <p>To begin with, yes. But we're looking to also support music, videos, stories, comics, etc. we've even
                considered supporting games and whatnot but we're not sure about those yet, entirely depends on interest
                we get on those.</p>
